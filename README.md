## Getting Started
Welcome to my OOP project! 

I am looking forward to creating and putting my oop skills to the test and creating this java application!
I am aiming personally for level 3 ("Level 3 : You can also use the GUI to enter in new rows to the dataset with feature values and known label
values (i.e. expand your training dataset). This should then recalculate the various permutations totals for
the rules (i.e. recalculate the classifier, based on pressing a button"))

I think this will be challenging but also enjoyable! My personal dataset was "PolicyIsActive". The very first thing ive had to do was to detirming what this acctually means! I have taken it as "Is an insurance policy active" . Based off of this ive had t create a CSV dataset

## Control Class 

This class is used to run the program. I thought of not having a control class but i have liked working with one all throughtout the year and including up to this point, it makes running the app a bit easier. Its also easier to manage objects etc

## GUI Class

This class is used to create everything to do with the GUI. The graphical user interface is what the user acctualy interacts with when using this app. To me its important that the GUI is clean and the user is able to understand how to use it in a very short amount of time.

## Dataset Class

The dataset class is used to process the dataset csv file. It opens and handles all the information.
