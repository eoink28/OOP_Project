## Getting Started
Welcome to my OOP project! 

I am looking forward to creating and putting my oop skills to the test and creating this java application!
I am aiming personally for level 3 ("Level 3 : You can also use the GUI to enter in new rows to the dataset with feature values and known label
values (i.e. expand your training dataset). This should then recalculate the various permutations totals for
the rules (i.e. recalculate the classifier, based on pressing a button"))

I think this will be challenging but also enjoyable! My personal dataset was "PolicyIsActive". The very first thing ive had to do was to detirming what this acctually means! I have taken it as "Is an insurance policy active" . Based off of this ive had t create a CSV dataset
